        <h4>What is Cryptocurrency (Crypto)? For short Crypto is a digital currency that is mananged by people through a decentralized network. Decentralized meaning multiple domain controllers in case if a server were to go down. What makes crypto so different from the common currency (differing on where you live) is that there is no central authroity over it. This means no government. It is a system ran by the people and it fluctuates based of the people.</h4>

One reason why it can explode is because it has similar components to Ethereum in the sense that idevelopers use it to make contracts and decentralized apps. Because of Ethereum's success, Cardano has it's potential.</h5>
          <h5>Tether is one of those cryptocurrencies that's very important because it is a mix of the crypto world, and the banking world. Tether is a 1-to-1 ratio with the US dollar, so it is an easy and simple way to move funds from crypto markets to banking systems. It's a blockchain that is great for converting currencies.</h5>

          <p>One huge misconception about cryptocurrency is that it's not safe and unsecure. Some crytography guarantees full anonymity that keep your whole identity protected. Crypto prospers through the people, becuase of this the government isn't in control of cryptogrophy and the transactions that occur.</p>

          <img src="./assets/fiat.jpg" alt="Crypto overthrowing Fiat currency">
          <p>Some beleive that crypto will take over the world in the next five years and wipe out banking systems. Although this is false, because crypto doesn't have the power yet to take out fiat currencies across the whole world. The issue is the crypto value flucuates a lot more than fiat currency.</p>
